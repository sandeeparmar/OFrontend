#Project summary

1. Ocean_frontend : is a modern React application for exploring Indian Ocean data with secure, role-aware access and rich, interactive visualization. The app provides authenticated dashboards, an ocean data explorer with a clickable map, and dedicated pages for analysis and alerts—aimed at turning oceanographic parameters into actionable insights.

2. Core purpose: Enable users to query, visualize, and interpret ocean parameters (temperature, salinity, depth, pressure, BGC metrics) across the Indian Ocean region.

#Key features:

-> Authentication and roles: Context-based auth gates routes; admin role unlocks the AdminPanel.

-> Protected routing: Users are redirected to login when unauthenticated; graceful navigation between dashboard, chatbot, admin, analyse, alert, and visualization routes.

-> Indian Ocean Data Explorer: Interactive SVG map for 20°E–120°E and 30°N–70°S. Click the map or enter coordinates to generate location-specific ocean data, including BGC parameters (chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate, phosphate).

-> Assistant-style UX: A right-panel “Ocean Data Assistant” chat stream echoes queries and returns structured, human-readable data summaries.

-> Filter panel: Depth, temperature, salinity, and data type filters ready for extending to real datasets.

-> Responsive UI: Tailwind-powered layout with clear information hierarchy and adaptable panels.


#Tech stack for frontend:
React (Create React App), react-router-dom, Tailwind CSS, lucide-react icons.
How it works:

Users sign in to access the main app. The visualization page translates clicks or typed coordinates into a bounded lat/lng, generates contextual ocean metrics, and overlays data near the selected map point while logging a chat-style response.
Extensibility:

Swap the simulated data generator with live APIs (e.g., Argo/GOOS).
Wire filters to back-end queries or client-side dataset filtering.
Expand analysis and alerting with real thresholds, jobs, and notifications.
Outcomes:

Faster exploration of location-specific ocean parameters.
Clear separation of concerns (auth, routing, visualization, analysis).
A strong foundation for integrating real observational datasets and operational monitoring.



#Summary about complete project  (Ocean Data Intelligence Platform)

->Query Processing: Users provide queries via voice/text using ASR and NLP; queries are routed to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline utilizing vector search (FAISS/Chroma) and metadata retrieval.

->Execution: MCP Server registers backend REST APIs as modular tools. The system converts oceanographic datasets (NetCDF → SQL/Parquet) for structured access. LLM determines the required MCP tool and invokes APIs, returning results in real time.

->Visualization: Output is displayed as interactive dashboards/maps (Streamlit, Dash, Plotly, Leaflet, Cesium) allowing advanced filtering, regional selection, and comparisons.

->Automation & Alerts: An automated analysis pipeline continuously monitors ocean data, detects anomalies/disasters, and sends event-driven alerts to scientists.

->AI Workflow: LLM dynamically selects APIs/datasets for query-adaptive, real-time responses; supports both voice and text NLQ.

->Semantic Search: Retrieves and combines SQL/Parquet (structured) and NetCDF (unstructured) data for concept-based queries.
